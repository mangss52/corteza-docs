= Importing and exporting namespaces

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* this is a temporary location; the documentation will be moved ove the integrator guide refactoring is merged.

{PRODUCT_NAME} makes it easy to export entire namespaces which can then be imported into an entirely different {PRODUCT_NAME} instance.

.To export the namespace:
. go to menu:{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}[],
. click on the btn:[Edit] button for the namespace you wish to export,
. click on the btn:[Export] button in the top-left corner to export the namespace,
. save the `.zip` file.

.To import the namespace:
. go to menu:{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}[],
. click on the btn:[Import] button for the top-left corner,
. drag'n drop the `.zip` file into the file drop area.

[CAUTION]
====
The exported namespace will exclude workflow references and access control permissions.
Those need to be configured manually after the fact.
