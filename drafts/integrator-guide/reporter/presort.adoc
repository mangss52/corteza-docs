Presort allows you to sort the items before they are even displayed.

First you add a column you wish to sort by and pick the indended direction.
If you wish to sort by multiple columns, you can do that by adding another parameter to the presort.
The first parameter is the primary sort target and all the other ones after it are secondary sort targets.
That means items will always be sorted by the first parameter and the items with the same primary value will be sorted by the secondary parameter and so on.
